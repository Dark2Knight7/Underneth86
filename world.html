                <p>
                    In each season you will face different challenges and obsticles. In the winter season you will experience deadly blizzards and different mutants in the world.

                <h2>Pál street boys</h2>
                <p>
                    The post-apocalyptic society of the Budapest Metro is formed from a collection of independent stations and powerful Factions. After years of bloody civil war between the fascists of Reich and communists of Redline, Hanza are now the dominant group. They have remained a relatively benign presence, promoting commerce and social freedoms, and are natural allies of the elite Spartan Order, who still strive to maintain peace in the metro...

                <p>
                    Everywhere on the surface of Moscow is cloaked in a veil of dangerous radiation. To breathe in this environment, Artyom and the Rangers must wear gas masks at all times on the surface. The Spartan Order had believed that outside of Moscow was just as uninhabitable, until now…

                <h2>DEMON</h2>
                <p>
                    The Demon, a huge winged beast, is well known to Metro residents as one of the deadliest creatures around. Like a grotesque bird of prey, this creature can grab humans from the ground, and drop them from great heights.
                </p>
                <h2>WATCHMAN</h2>
                <p>
                    With protruding joints, fearsome claws and yellowing teeth, the Watchman is one of the most common creatures in post-apocalyptic Moscow. Running in packs, these savage mutants stalk every street and tunnel.
                    A lone Watchman is no match for a trained Spartan, but their sentries can quickly summon reinforcements if not dealt with quickly and quietly...
