                <h1>STEP OUT INTO SUMMER...</h1>
                <p>
                    In each season you will face different challenges and obsticles. In the summer season you will experience deadly sandstorms, pyromaniacs and different mutants in the world.

                <h2>FIRE WORSHIPPERS</h2>
                <p>
                    The Fire Worshippers are the master class in the neo-feudal society of the desert, and they carry themselves with corresponding aplomb and disregard to their opponents' humanity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their name comes from the cult of "Holy Flame" created by their leader, The Baron, to keep the enslaved population at bay.

                <h1>HAZARDS</h1>
                <h2>SAND STORMS</h2>
                <p>
                    The desert is an unforgiving environment at the best of times. The unbearable heat, relentless maintenance required to deal with the sand and - if you're especially unlucky - the storms. These walls of sand reduce visibility and can well prove fatal if cover isn't found in time.

                <h1>MUTANTS</h1>
                <h2>LURKER</h2>
                <p>
                    A timid creature, the Lurkers spend most of their time roaming the surface looking for carrion to feast on.
                    If you are hunting these you'll need quick reflexes, they will often attack and then dart for cover in nearby burrows to regroup.
                    They will avoid combat where possible, often running away at the first sign of trouble. They only attack when in groups or provoked.
