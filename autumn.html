                <h1>STEP OUT INTO AUTUMN</h1>
                <p>
                   In each season you will face different challenges and obsticles. In the autumn season you will face the native peapole of the forests who started their living in the forests after the war, because of the loss of therir houses. There will be many wildlife animals who mutated through out the years of toxicity.

                <h2>Children Of The Forest</h2>
                <p>
                   The Children Of The Forest are, essentially, a group of children who became stranded at a scout camp when the war started, and never really got a chance to grow up.
                   Raised by their camp master, who they call "Teacher", they have adapted to survive in the wilderness against all threats. Be that the changing weather, fierce creatures, bandit attacks or unwelcome guests.

                <h1>HAZARDS</h1>
                <h2>Survival</h2>
                <p>
                   Being cut off from civilization is a real challenge to your ability to survive. It's not just the local wildlife and natural hazards that might kill you, but also the lack of resources. Ammunition and supplies are not easy to find here.

                <h1>MUTANTS</h1>
                <h2>Wolves</h2>
                <p>
                   Not all beasts roaming the surface are mutants, but unfortunately, as in this case, they can be equally vicious.
                   Ravenous and territorial, wolves should be considered incredibly dangerous. Even a lone wolf can cause problems if not dealt with quickly. However, wolves are pack animals by nature, so if you cross paths with them, you'll need to have keen wits and good aim to get away unscathed.
                </p>
                <h2>The Bear</h2>
                <p>
                   It is said that when encountering a bear in the wild you should remain calm and never run. It goes without saying that this rule does not apply here.
                   The Mutated Bear is a lethal threat to anything that gets close, be it man or beast. Thick bones and tough gristled muscles make it extremely resistant to any kind of firearm save for the heaviest ones, but its thick fur is rather susceptible to incendiary weapons.
