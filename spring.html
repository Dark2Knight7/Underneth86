                <h1>STEP OUT INTO SPRING...</h1>
                <p>
                    In each season you will face different challenges and obsticles. In the spring season you will experience deadly bandits, degenerate people on the streets of Budapest, strange phenomenon called "anomalys"that are highly hazzardous, and different mutants in the world.

                <h1>FACTIONS</h1>
                <h2>FANATICS</h2>
                <p>
                    Many closed communities have evolved in the wasteland, but few are stranger than the fanatics near the Duna river. Believing all technology has been man's folly, and only its rejection will bring them salvation, these fanatics, under the watchful eye of their sinister and oddly charismatic leader Silantius, have taken to worshipping a great and powerful beast that lurks beneath the water…
                </p>
                <h2>BANDITS</h2>
                <p>
                    When there is no hope of ever returning to normal life, it is no surprise that gangs of bandits have sprung up across the wasteland. Ferocious and merciless, those that have cultivated on the banks of Duna river have seemed to have reached a peace between themselves, and have focussed their attentions on terrifying the locals, and robbing them of anything and everything of value.

                <h1>HAZARDS</h1>
                <h2>ANOMALY</h2>
                <p>
                    A buzzing blue ball of electric energy, anomalies are an oddity of the post-apocalyptic world. Extremely dangerous to any within a certain radius, these strangely alluring spheres can appear in day or night, but tend to follow a similar path every time.

                <h1>MUTANTS</h1>
                <h2>SHRIMP</h2>
                <p>
                    It was not only creatures above the ground that were shaped by the radiation that plagued the surface. Known as Shrimp, these mysterious aquatic life forms seemed to evolve from some form of crustacean. The male of the species will use its huge shelled arms as a shield, and do quite a lot of damage if it takes a swipe at you, whilst the female favours spitting its corrosive mucus from a longer distance.
                </p>
                <h2>HUMANIMALS</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike the name suggests, these horrifying creatures are anything but human. These beasts are not deadly when alone, but tend to travel in packs so they can be a force to be reckoned with. They have also learnt to throw heavy projectiles, like bricks or stones, and so are dangerous when nearby or further away.
